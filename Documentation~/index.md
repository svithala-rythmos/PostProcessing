 **Post-processing** is the process of applying full-screen filters and effects to a cameraâ€™s image buffer before it is displayed to screen. It can drastically improve the visuals of your product with little setup time. 
 You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties. 
 The images below demonstrate a scene with and without post-processing.
